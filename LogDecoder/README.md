# Log Decoder

The plan is:

* Decode the GPS data logged on the box using an existing library
* Calculate the distance travelled
* Show a (zoomable?) map of where the box has gone
* Manage the box so the data doesn't overflow the firmware
* Manage the data so it can all be stored somewhere (database? file? "The Cloud"?)
